# Intro to Java Assignment: OOP Hangman

### Overview

Using Java, you will create a hangman command-line game considering the *_Four principles of Object-Oriented Programming_*.

![Hangman Cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/748dfa12c9bda84dd5c7475028cadf9dafe17447/01-Class-Content/11-js-constructors/02-Homework/Images/01-Hangman-Cli.gif?token=AAgRJ5KimQgw-Z4U8QgUOk51B8p_U95Bks5bRSszwA%3D%3D)

## Instructions

The completed game should meet the following criteria:

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `java.util.Scanner` package.

2. Feel free to use as many different types of classes as you are able to, but at a minimum, you must create the following constructor functions:

  * **Word**: Used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. This should contain word specific logic and data.

  * **Letter**: Used for each letter in the current word. Each letter object should either display an underlying character, or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. This should contain letter specific logic and data.

3. You must keep track of the user's remaining guesses and prompt the user if they would like to end the game if none remain.

### Notes

* Since this assignment is a command-line application, you don't need to deploy it anywhere. You will, however, be required to upload it to Github.

* Remember to include a `README.md` file showcasing your application and giving steps on how to compile and run!

### Minimum Requirements

Attempt to complete activity as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed.
